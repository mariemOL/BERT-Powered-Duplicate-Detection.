# Opportunity Management System with Duplicate Detection

This project is an opportunity management application that detects duplicate or similar entries in a B2B context using semantic similarity through BERT-based models. It leverages Flask for the web interface, MySQL for the database, and the `sentence-transformers` library to identify similarities. The project also includes budget-based duplicate filtering and presents results through an easy-to-use web interface.

## Features
- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses BERT model embeddings to compute semantic similarity between a target opportunity and existing entries in the database.
- **Budget-Based Matching**: Considers both similarity in text and budget tolerance to improve duplicate detection accuracy.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based interface for easy interaction, allowing users to enter new opportunities and view potential duplicates.
- **MySQL Database Integration**: Stores and retrieves opportunity data for analysis and comparison.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, MySQL
- **ML Model**: BERT-based `sentence-transformers` (using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for sentence embedding)
- **Database**: MySQL for opportunity data storage and retrieval

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- MySQL Database
- Flask
- `sentence-transformers` library
- PyTorch (for `sentence-transformers` compatibility)


## Project Structure
- **app.py**: Main application file with Flask routes and duplicate detection logic.
- **templates/**: HTML files for the web interface.
  - `form.html`: Input form for entering new opportunities.
  - `results.html`: Displays results with duplicate detection details.

## Usage
1. **Enter Opportunity Data**:
   - Access the homepage and fill in opportunity details: client, title, description, and budget.

2. **View Duplicate Suggestions**:
   - After submission, the app compares the input opportunity with existing entries and displays any potential duplicates based on text similarity and budget tolerance.

## Model & Algorithm Details
- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from `sentence-transformers` is used to encode opportunity descriptions for similarity comparison.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity is used to compare embeddings, with a threshold of `0.7` for flagging duplicates.
- **Budget Tolerance**: Budget is considered similar if within ±10% of the original value.

## Future Enhancements
- **Add New Filtering Parameters**: Enhance duplicate detection by adding more parameters.
- **Expand Database Integration**: Allow CRUD operations from the web interface for better management.
- **Automate Model Updates**: Automate model updates to maintain accuracy as more data is added.
